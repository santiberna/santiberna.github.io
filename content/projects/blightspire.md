Summary: "Year long Custom Tech project where I worked on a **code quality and testing pipeline** using GitHub workflows, building the engine using **CMake** and integrated a **scripting language (Wren)** for improving design iteration times."

## Introduction

**Blightspire is a WIP custom engine game for my year long custom tech project at BUAS**. It is a boomer shooter that incorporates fast paced gameplay, pixelized and grainy graphics and a lot of particles! 

**Our target platform is the Steam Deck, but there will also be a PC build. It will also be released on Steam by the end of the academic year, so stay tuned.**

The code itself is open source: [here is a link to it!](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Y2024-25-PR-BB)

Our team was composed of 9 programmers and 1 designer / producer.

## What I did 

Within the team, I was assigned the role of Engine Programmer.

- **Integrated a scripting language**
- **Designed the architecture of the Engine**
- **Setup build system using (CMake)**
- Added automated tests and linting for Pull Requests (GitHub Workflows)
- Added a Unit Testing framework (GoogleTest) 

## Scripting with Wren

We needed scripting language for making gameplay code, since it would allow for **easier iteration times by avoiding recompilations of the engine**. For that I chose a lesser know scripting language called [Wren](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren).

I chose it because:
- It has syntax similar to C, reducing the barrier of entry for the other programmers.
- Relatively fast, on par with Lua.
- Good documentation

The main USP of scripting that I implemented was runtime reloading, since **it made the experience of developing gameplay for the rest of the team much more enjoyable and responsive.** All of our [player movement](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Y2024-25-PR-BB/blob/main/game/gameplay/movement.wren) and [gun logic](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Y2024-25-PR-BB/blob/main/game/weapon.wren) was implemented in Wren.

I used the [wrenbind17 library ](https://github.com/matusnovak/wrenbind17) for creating wren bindings for C++ since it was much easier and less error prone than the C API.

## CMake build system

To build the codebase I used CMake. To make it organized, **I designed a system of handling each module of the engine as a separate library**, replicating the way Unreal Engine manages its modules:

<p align="center">

</p>

Each module has its own public and private folders, that define the visibility of files between dependent modules. This solution **allows the engine to have cleanly defined dependencies between modules**. I created [a set of helpers for defining modules](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Y2024-25-PR-BB/blob/main/scripts/cmake/code-modules.cmake), so adding one is as easy as:

```cmake
add_library(Renderer)
module_default_init(Renderer)

target_link_libraries(Renderer
    PUBLIC Core 
    PUBLIC Application # other engine modules

    PUBLIC VulkanAPI # third party libraries
)
```

## Engine module architecture

On the topic of modules, in order to add a new "manager" class to the engine, **I created a very simple [ModuleInterface](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Y2024-25-PR-BB/blob/main/engine/core/public/module_interface.hpp) to implement for the Renderer, Input, Audio, etc... classes.** 

In main, we just add all the modules we need and run the engine. **[The Engine class](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Y2024-25-PR-BB/blob/main/engine/core/public/engine.hpp) is simply a service locator for all the modules and manages their lifetime, retrieval and also update order.**

```c++
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    MainEngine instance;

    instance
        .AddModule<ApplicationModule>()
        .AddModule<AudioModule>()
        .AddModule<RendererModule>()
        .AddModule<GameModule>()
        // More modules here...

    return instance.Run(); // Runs event loop internally
}
```

This approach has it's problems, but it is very flexible and easy to build upon. You can also easily disable certain modules in code for debugging.

## GitHub Automated Testing

To avoid main breaking every week, I also setup some automated [GitHub workflows to test building the engine on both Windows and Linux and run our unit tests](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Y2024-25-PR-BB/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml), as well as [another workflow for performing a linting review of a pull request](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Y2024-25-PR-BB/blob/main/.github/workflows/cpp-linter.yml):

## More to come

The engine is still WIP, so I will likely add more here... stay tuned!

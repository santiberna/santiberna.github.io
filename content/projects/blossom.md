## Introduction

**Blossom is a game where you play as a bee collecting honey around a beautiful 3D environment.** This project originally started as a custom rendering engine for nature scenes. **Developed for both PC and the PS5.**

The game is available on [Itch.io](https://buas.itch.io/blossom-engine) and the [OpenGL port is available on GitHub](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Blossom) 

Our team was composed of 6 programmers, 2 designers and 3 visual artists.

## What I did 

Within the team, I was assigned the role of Engine Programmer.

- **Procedural placement of Props**
- **Editor GUI for modifying editing attributes**
- **Gameplay related to Points of Interest**
- Serializing and loading scenes for release
- Model loading for GLTF files

### Procedural placement of Props using Perlin Noise and Density Masks

For placing prop objects around a scene, **we used perlin noise combined with greyscale textures** for sampling the probability that an object would be spawned:

</p>

<div class="row">
  <div style="width: 50%">
    <img src="/images/blossom/flowers1.png" alt="Example 1" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div style="width: 50%">
    <img src="/images/blossom/flower2.png" alt="Example 2" style="width:100%">
  </div>
</div>


Combining this with a lot of other randomization parameters for size and tilt, **we got a very effective and basic way of generating landscapes.**

### Editor GUI using Dear ImGui

**I created a robust editor for a scene with the ability to add an arbitrary number of props to a scene** and tweak a lot of the generation parameters. This was also built upon by another colleague who integrated the FastNoise library for generating density maps.

This also involved serializing and loading a scene at runtime, **which I also implemented** using the [Cereal library](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal).

### The Honey Collection Minigame

Towards the end of the project I worked a bit on the gameplay. More concretely, **I created the logic for the growing sequence when the player completes the honey collection minigame and the orbiting bees around the hive as you deliver more honey**

---

Blossom is a game where you play as a bee collecting honey around a beautiful 3D environment. This project originally started as a custom rendering engine for nature scenes. **Developed for both PC and the PS5.**

The game is available on [Itch.io (Link)](https://buas.itch.io/blossom-engine) and the [OpenGL port is available on GitHub (Link)](https://github.com/BredaUniversityGames/Blossom) 

## Contributions

Within the team, I was assigned the role of Engine Programmer.

- **Procedural placement of Props**
- **Gameplay related to Points of Interest**
- **Editor GUI for modifying editing attributes**
- Serializing and loading scenes for release
- Model loading for GLTF files

## Perlin Noise and Density Masks

In order to design nature scenes, We needed an algorithm that would procedurally place props like flowers and trees in a terrain (doing it practically would be too much work). **We used perlin noise combined with greyscale textures** for sampling the probability that an object would be present:

TODO: PHOTO OF DENSITY MAP + RESULT WITH TREES
TODO: PHOTO OF ENVIRONMENT

Combining this with a lot of other randomization parameters for size and tilt, **we got a very effective and basic way of generating landscapes.**

## Editor GUI using ImGui

**I created a robust editor for the scene with the ability to add an arbitrary number of props to a scene** and tweak a lot of the generation parameters. This was also built upon by another colleague who integrated the FastNoise library for generating density maps.

This also involved serializing and loading a scene at runtime, **which I also implemented** using the [Cereal library (Link)](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal).

## Beautification Sequence

Towards the end of the project I worked a bit on the gameplay. More concretely, **I created the logic for the growing sequence when the player completes the honey collection minigame.**
